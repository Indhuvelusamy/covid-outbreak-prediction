        <h5>Tamil Nadu chief secretary V Irai Anbu wrote to all district collectors on Monday, commending their performance in the third mega Covid-19 vaccination drive conducted on Sunday.

          The drive covered 24,85,814 people, taking the total number of vaccinated persons in the state to 1,38,60,328 in September. As per the release by the health department, the state administered 9.85 lakh more doses than it had targeted. The vaccination drive was carried out at 23,436 centres across Tamil Nadu.

          However, the chief secretary also pointed out that certain districts were lagging behind in administering the doses. “Some of the collectors and the associated district officials are lagging behind and they must put their house in order to speed up vaccination,”
           the chief secretary said. Tamil Nadu is currently at the 13th position among the states in terms of vaccine coverage.

           “Supply constraint is one reason, and we are taking all steps to address the issue. Meanwhile, I would request you all, particularly the laggers, to redouble your efforts and improve your daily vaccination performance,” Anbu added.

           According to the performance chart issued by the chief secretary, the health units in Coimbatore, Theni, Dindigul and Kanyakumari occupy the top four ranks and their performance has been termed as ‘excellent’.</h5>

        <h3 style="font-style: italic ;color:red;"> Tamil Nadu requests Centre to postpone idea of resuming Covid-19 vaccine exports</h3>
        <p>The Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday requested the Centre to postpone resumption of exports of Covid-19 vaccines, saying only one third of the country’s population have been fully inoculated so far and 115 crore vaccines are still required to give the shots to all the people.

          Minister for medical and family welfare Ma Subramanian put forth the request after Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday said that exports of surplus Covid-19 vaccines would resume next month under the ‘Vaccine Maitri’ programme.

          Talking to reporters after unveiling the simulation centre at Apollo Hospitals in Vanagaram on Tuesday, Subramanian said the global medical fraternity welcomed the vaccination programme in India, as inoculating people holds the key in the fight against the COVID-19 virus.

  Meanwhile, the state government has also said that physical classes for the students of classes 1 to 8 will resume from 1 November.

  A decision to this effect was taken considering the views expressed by the health experts, educationists, and parents that the absence of formal schooling has caused huge loss of learning as well as depression among the school children, Stalin said in a statement. Regular classes for the students of 9 to 12 have been going on.


  CM Stalin has urged people to be cautious during the ensuing festival season and to avoid visiting crowded places to prevent a third wave of Covid-19. All commercial establishments should adhere to the guidelines issued by the state government.

  Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu today clocked 1,630 new Covid-19 infections, including a returnee from Karnataka, pushing the caseload to 26,60,553, the health department said.

        <p>Chennai: In line with the Tamil Nadu government’s tentative proposal to resume in-person classes for students of grades 9th-12th from September 1, a detailed list of Standards Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been shared. Health department authorities have been instructed to coordinate with all schools (Govt, Govt-aided and private) to ensure that reopening happens in accordance with the guidelines.

          As per the SOPs, there must be at least 6 feet of distance between students who are seated in a room, or one student one bench is recommended, with the same 6 feet norm. It is even suggested that if the weather is pleasant, classes can be conducted in outdoor spaces. Staggering of entry and exit times and provision of lanes have been suggested to ensure safe passage at gates.

          In terms of occupancy, it has been recommended that staggered/reduced timings be followed in the timetables for different classes. 50% attendance, odd-even formula for classes, running schools in shifts have also been mentioned. In cases of small classrooms, it has been suggested that classes be held in larger areas such as libraries, labs, etc.

          Schools have been urged not to undertake events where COVID-19 protocols cannot be adhered to, functions or celebrations must be avoided. </p>
